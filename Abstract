This project aims to classify forest cover types using the Covertype dataset. Data preprocessing included memory optimization and sampling. A Random Forest model was tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to identify the best hyperparameters efficiently. Training and validation were performed on reduced data to accelerate processing. The model achieved reliable performance, and tuning revealed optimal values for n_estimators and max_depth. This setup balances accuracy with runtime efficiency and is well-suited for large-scale multiclass classification tasks.
